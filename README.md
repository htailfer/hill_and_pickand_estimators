# hill_and_pickand_estimators
Estimating the GEV parameter of a returns dstribution with both Pickand and Hill estimators

The estimation has been made on a time series of prices so it was necessary to start by computing the returns

Pickand estimator can be read by reading the y-axis of the first time the curve stops "shaking".
Hill estimator can be read as the limit of the curve in + infinity
